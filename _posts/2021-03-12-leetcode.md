Personal repository for data structures and algorithm solutions in LeetCode.

## Table of contents

Due to the amount of topics found in LeetCode, problems can be found in the following categories:

* [array](https://github.com/ronelzb/leetcode/tree/master/array)

## Evaluating time and space complexity of solutions

LeetCode uses a statistical system of time and space evaluation that is different of other pages like HackerRank, and this system also varies on the language that you use: A Java solution will be compared against other Java solutions and so on. The complexity required in the problem will give you a hint of what is required for the overall solution:

1. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n^2" style="vertical-align:unset" /> are the easiest to identify
2. For <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?logn" />, will typically be a binary search or related problem
3. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?nlogn" /> will be merge sort or divide-and-conquer
4. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n!" /> for factorials
5. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2^n" style="vertical-align:unset" /> can be identified if the result set happens to scale like a binary pattern, like backtracking or permutations in general

[Cracking the Coding Interview]({{ "/2017/03/09/cracking-the-interview-code" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) has such a good section on time/space complexities and how to figure them out.
