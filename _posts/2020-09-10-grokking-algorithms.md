*[Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms){:target="_blank"}* is a fully illustrated, friendly guide that teaches you how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face every day as a programmer.
<!--more-->
This book is a great introduction to Python programming and algorithms in general. We'll start with basics like sorting and searching then move on to more complex problems.

## Contents

1. Introduction to algorithms.
2. Selection sort.
3. Recursion.
4. Quicksort.
5. Hash tables.
6. Breadth-first search.
7. Dijkstra's algorithm.
8. Greedy algorithms.
9. Dynamic programming.
10. K nearest neighbors.
11. Where to go next.

## Dependencies

This repo was created using Python 3 and the [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) IDE.
